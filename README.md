# Data Analysis of ENEM 2023

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the **ENEM 2023 microdata**. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, important insights were extracted about student performance in different areas of the exam. Below are the main points covered in the analysis:

## 1. **Data Structure**
The dataset contains detailed information about ENEM 2023 participants, including data on students' **grade**, **gender**, **school type** and **geographic location**. To facilitate the analysis, new columns were created, such as **region** and **school type**.

## 2. **Distribution of Grades**
- **Average Grades**: The average grades by subject (Natural Sciences, Humanities, Languages, Mathematics and Writing) were calculated, segmented by **region**, **sex** and **type of school**.
- **Median and Standard Deviation**: In addition to the averages, the median and standard deviation of the grades were also calculated, allowing a more detailed view of the data distribution.

## 3. **Insights by Region**
- The analysis revealed significant variations in the average grades between the different **regions of Brazil**. The **Southeast region** obtained the best averages in the subjects of Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Writing, while the **North** presented the lowest performances in some areas.

## 4. **Performance by Sex**
- The **average grades by sex** showed notable differences between **male** and **female**, with some subjects presenting significant variations. In general, women excelled in **Writing**, while men performed slightly better in **Mathematics**.

## 5. **Impact of School Type**
- The analyses indicated that students from **private** schools had, on average, the best grades in all subjects, followed by students from **federal** schools. On the other hand, **municipal** and **state** schools had the lowest averages.

## 6. **Visualizations**
- **Boxplots** were generated to identify the distribution of grades and identify outliers in regions and subjects.
- **Line Graphs** showed the variation in average grades by sex in the various subjects.
- **Bar Graphs** showed the comparison between average grades by **school type** and **sex**.

## 7. **Correlation between Subjects**
- The correlation analysis between subject grades revealed that **Writing** and **Languages** have a strong positive correlation, while **Mathematics** has a moderate correlation with the other areas.

## 8. **Conclusions**
- There is a disparity in the performance of ENEM 2023 students depending on **geographic location**, **gender** and **type of school**.
- The analysis suggests that **educational infrastructure** and **regional conditions** have a major impact on student performance.
